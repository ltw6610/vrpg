>>>>>>>>>>>>>These are ideas that have been proposed but not adopted or accepted, but may still be. This is attempting to be comprehensive, but is not complete. Be sure to quote the "Idea anchor" post so you aren't skipped.
 
Please keep in mind that most of these ideas will not be used.
 
Newest suggestions will be near the top of the list. Some ideas that are branches of another idea will usually be included with the first post that started the idea, with posts number separating the different brainstorms of the idea. Ideas that contradict cemented ideas are at the very bottom and will not be as carefully tracked.

>Right before leaving, the king has you deliver a drought of necrotic basil to Moe. His only explanation is "time travel shenanigans". another idea is upon receiving the drought, Moe comments that it's almost as expensive as his video card. Apparently it makes chicken broth taste so good you die. He plugs it into his computer as coolant fluid. [Shopkeeper] has you run some errands, and in exchange teaches you basic mechanics. Her final and most difficult lesson is how to perform Small Talk.

>Having all the tans as playable characters is rather unfeasible, rather focus on fleshing out the mechanics of the duo while maybe having the tans be summons or maybe just spells with powers being tied to a board. /k/ could be a defence ignoring one thst deals high damage but has a high fail rate etc.

>>A spooky pirate crew completely made out of skelly bros singing a parody of many sea shanties (with anons' voices perfoming them with a horrible british accent to top it off) about pirating games, goyims, corporations, fuck Blizzard, scams, Space Citizen, etc

You could promise /k/ he can blow shit up that's bigger than a rabbit of he comes with you.
>
>I like the idea of being able to recruit /k/ since Wes already has gunplay. Maybe that could be a part of his mysterious origin. /k/ could be a type of red mage, where he doesn't inflict a lot of damage because no one ever taught him to use a gun and he can poorly heal companions with home made mres of spaghettios and store bought jerky.
 
? >>282596: Song submission: https://vocaroo.com/caOBf33vSkx
?>>282132: rhythmic synchronized button presses. Say you got put in a battle and instead of the standard turn based combat it became a rap battle like parappa or a dance battle like ddr. you could do that to recruit /mu/ or /lgbt/. Just once out of nowhere in the middle of the game and the mechanic never really comes up again(like the motorcycle scene in FFVII). Hell, you could even do it like san andreas lowrider battles if you want to add a faction of Hood Rats you need to impress for some reason. They could just be rats in hoodies that love now and laters.
 
 
?>>282063: glitches[intentional?]
 
 
?>The final true ending boss is (you)
 
?>>281729
>each dungeon should be centered around enemies exploiting a certain kind of weakness, meaning that specialized party builds are required for every dungeon
 
?>>281646
>dungeons should force you to manage your resources wisely
 
?>>281601
>add class levels and job levels. Classes are pre-defined and have the most weight when it comes to stats, jobs are secondary and serve as some sort of specialization. Furthermore, using certain techniques causes you to become more proficient in them, allowing for nearly full customization of the characters. Moreover, magic should be divided into 10 schools like in Romancing SaGa Minstrel Song, with complementary magic schools as these:
> Pyrology <-> Hydrology
> Aerology <-> Terrology
> Illusion <-> Demonology
> Cosmology <-> Sorcery
> Bewitchery <-> Necromancy
>Each character shall be allowed to be proficient in three different magic schools, but obviously not in two complementary magic schools. Each magic school should have its own independent level, classes and jobs can cause certain magic schools to level up faster.
 
?>>281391
>combo attacks. Attacks from two different weapons can cause combos. Magic attacks serve as linking elements between combos, allowing for triple and quadruple combos. >>281729: enemies should also have the ability to perform combos and their moveset should be adjusted for that.
 
 
?>>281338
>certain weapon types are more efficient against certain enemy types. I.e. piercing weapons (like spears) are more efficient against fishes.
 
?>>281301
>too much grinding causes you to get locked out of the final dungeon and get a bad ending.
 
?>>280538
>Tthe party death screen should fade to black and then fade into the Skyrim openning
 
?>>280523
>>Jay's skills all use typical mana no matter what she's doing in the skill.
>>Some of Wes's skills are based on targetting specific body parts to inflict debuffs or deal critical damage, at the cost of some accuracy. Additionally, instead of a typical MP cost, Wes' gun skill cost Ammo items to use
>>Moe's skills are primarily buffs and debuffs, but they have cooldowns in addition to MP costs
>>Hoechan's skills have a limited use pool that's refilled whenever you go to an inn, based on the management nature of a lot of H-RPGs, Sengoku Rance and Rance Quest in particular.
>>ARPG rival character who joins the party in the lategame. He uses a combo system similar to Lisa the Painful RPG and has access to the TP gauge to reward him for pulling off bigger combos or act as a limit break in dire situations
>>Gacha RPG party member who uses money to use her skills
>>Tabletop RPG gambler party member. He fights using different decks and dice with random effects, heavy damage variation or high critical hit rates.

?>>278493

?>>271740
>The "Nuclear Winter" that turned the coomlands into snowy landscapes is actually the aftermath of a milennia of heady, thick farts. This is the planet's way to deal with the high amounts of lethal gas that cloud the surface. This is what the Coomland's main theme would be: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdvP_2hVE04] The party members in Coomlands are separated from you, and due to the high poison in the air in the center of the island (where Todd lives) and them not being in a safe place, die by breathing too much farts
 
?>>271782
>Alternate dimension H-Tan farts after she resized to be giant. H in this case stands for Hydrogenbomb
 
?>>278008
>leveling up certain stats causes others to decrease, i.e. leveling up evasion causes vitality to go down.
 
?>>277985
>Set the game around 3 to 5 years into the past as the "present", if the time travel plot arise, we can use early 4chan era as the past, and current year as a possible future to avoid the game becoming dated. It also reduce the number of -tan we need to design initially.
 
?>>277972
>a character/class/job which can capture monsters and use them in battle.
 
?>>277900
>add one way doors in dungeons
 
?>>277808
>add turn order manipulation like in SaGa Scarlet Grace

?>>277599
>vancian spellcasting system
 
?>>277554
>a dungeon which requires you to split your party in multiple sub-parties.
 
?>>277552
>Elixirs are also rare candy, but can't be used out of combat.
 
?>>277539
>Add spinners and teleporters like in Wizardry
 
?>>277523
>a cooldown on some abilities, like items, so you can't just spam elixirs all day long
 
 
?>>277375: A dungeon located in a literal basement in Coomlands. We can probably get shit-ton of inspiration from room/battlestation threads. It would be neat to include references to especially infamous cases, like Mad Max Ogre from /tv/ or Fridgebro.
 
 
?>>276963: Enough ideas. Just fucking make something.
 
?>>277085: enemies with stat-draining attacks
 
?>>276905: a completely randomized dungeon with randomized encounters and bosses
 
?>>276865: certain actions take up more than one turn
 
?>>276778: Smart enemy AI that tries to constantly exploit your weaknesses
 
?>>276719: 10% chance for an encounter to be a miniboss
 
?>>276641: Only way to reach Toddfs lair is by scaling a mountain on horseback.
 
?>>276616: A magic combination system like in Dungeon Master
 
?>>276612: Happy Merchant NPC who sells you overpriced items. Some are dogshit and some are among the best armors/weapons in the game. extra hidden lore to imply his actions are what started the plot
 
?>>276594: Formation system from Romancing SaGa 2 and 3
 
?>>276582: a job system
 
?>>276572: enemies that steal your items and equipment
 
?>>276567: Hesburger dungeon where the back of the building is inexplicably a labyrinth.
 
?>>276499: No access to items during a fight; you can only equip characters with certain items.
 
?>>276478: make the game very exploration-heavy like Ultima
 
?>>276464: Permanent level downs like in Wizardry
 
?>>276451: Farming spells that yield plant items for your inventory.
 
?>>276450: an equipment crafting system
 
?>>27643: permadeath mode
 
?>>276427: Mandatory stealth sections.
 
?>>276420: party members age as they level up
 
?>>276398: one really big, confusing dungeon would be cool
 
?>>276383: Lots of optional bosses each highly specialized in a different gimmick. an example would be one boss themed around giving itself extra turns, while another only uses draining attacks, or another has tons of ways to whittle down your MP
 
?>>276374: a very large post-game dungeon without save points to pay homage to FF3's crystal tower
 
?>>276331: breakable weapons
 
 
?>>276310: Make some attacks use HP like in some SMT games.
 
?>>276298: add LP from SaGa games
 
?>>276285: a boss rush mode
 
 
?>>276282: there really should be a lot if not all the board-tans present as npcs throughout the game.
 
?>>276267: A party member who canft attack; only knows buffs, debuffs, and healing.
 
?>>276259: Add boost points like in octopath
 
?>>276254: press-turn from SMT
 
?>>276235: Unlimited Saga's reel system for combat
 
 
?>>276224: Option to change CIAfs fate through a series of interactions in various locations. If you convince him to not go after Bane, he will remain alive and [spoiler]join your party[/spoiler]
 
?>>276223: enemies scale to your level
 
 
?>>276200: confurable[?] encounter rate
 
?>>276185: trap rooms in dungeons
 
?>>275152: have the whole Todd vs Wes and Jay thing be a Dev/Producer vs Player/Consumer thematic, kind of like God vs Man or Creator vs Created
 
?>>272867:Cow party member that heals allies with milk.
 
?>>272706: A gambler type of party member who also represents the /tg/ board.
 
?>>271810
>>Two spellbooks of summoning exist in the world, with one appearing fairly early and the other appearing significantly later. If you use it on Jay, she gains a spell that deals massive damage, but costs 75% of her max MP to use. If you use it on Wes, he conjures a rat who becomes a party member, but the rat has terrible growths and a very limited skill set. [spoiler]Rat can evolve into Thunder Rat[/spoiler]
>>Spoony Bard party member who becomes more depressed and unhinged as the game progresses, everyone is convinced he will kill himself
>>Biggs and Wedge show up as a boss
 
?>>270177: A character that is constantly "betraying" both you and the enemy's side. Like Kain from FFIV but done constantly
 
?>>267364: Sidequest where you have to get Jay McNugggets and a McFlurry at 12 AM.
 
?>>266684: have achievements pop up once in a while referencing classic rpgs.
 
?>>266310: the map should be based on the order of the board, starting from /v/ or /vrpg/. If the initial goal is to head to /g/, if starting from /v/ the party will go past /p/,/o/,/m/, and /k/ to reach /g/, unless they found the transportation at /o/ or something
 
?>>266264: Make region 1 entirely blue board-related and to the same with region 2 and red boards (as well as stuff like Coomlands).
 
?>>266235: recruitable ninja girl
 
?>>265608: a group of spurdos who give you hints on how to progress, but in cyptic spurdo speak
 
?>>265335: side quest idea with recruitable rat:
>>game has pet store
>>it's closed all the time
>>ask npc about it
>>says the owner went off into a cave crying
>>go to cave, get to end
>>there's an airport
>>ask npc about crying pet store owner
>>took an airplane to some city
>>ask about tickets
>>no flight out
>>much later in game end up near city where the pet store owner went
>>ask npc, she's staying at a hotel
>>go to hotel, get her room number
>>go to room, door is kicked in and no one is inside
>>ask npc, ninjas took some girl to a cave
>>go to cave, get to end
>>fight ninjas, rescue grill
>>ask her about rat
>>she doesn't know about rat, she is not pet store owner
>>she is presidents daughter
>>says she knows about pet store girl, she is probably back at pet store now(no explanation)
>>offers to give you flight to airport nearby
>>accept
>>go to pet store, it's open
>>ask about rats
>>"ewe, they're almost as disgusting as (player name). get out of my store or I call cops."
>side quest over
 
?>>265018: The game asks for the player's actual name, like OFF and Earthbound, but instead of it coming into play, it's just the name the characters make fun of like "hey, it's a better name than (player name)" , "yeah (player name) is an awful name". >>265244: late in the game, if we use this idea, then Todd should revel that, since the player started the game and "released" Todd" that we're the real villain.
 
?>>264831: recruitable rat >>264913: capped at level 1 and is purely useless. >>264936: But also have lots of hinting throughout the game that there's something you can do to make him the strongest party member. 
It's all lies. He remains useless. >>265059: make one singular part where the party has to get through an obstacle and instead of finding the key Jay and Wes just send the Rat to go unlock the door, so you play as him for that part. >>265088: alternatively, you do that, but then the rat doesn't come back so you have to find another way to open the door. When you open it, it's sleeping. >>265157: Or he gets caught in a mouse trap. >>265018: Adding to this idea, when they find the recruitable rat, the characters should name it after the player. "Ew, it's eating garbage and living in its own shit" "sounds like a (player name) to me"
 
?>>264724: post-apocalyptic, earthbound like cities, wild west and sci-fi robot setting without normal humans. last area is based on skyrim.
 
?>>264256: add green text and red text in addition to dialog front color for aesthetic and emphasis purpose
 
?>>263923: SaGa-like leveling and sparking system
 
?>>263702: AI Dungeon-like companion dialogue feature with character personality based on standard anime types like tsundere/yandere/kuudere/dandere with a subset of variable appearance traits such as twintalils/himecut/hair color/etc plus relationship development and management (intimacy/dates/etc).
 
?>>263623: Make a "youtuber/streamer mode" checkbox in the options menu that claims to remove all profanity from the game, but in actuality it replaces every word in the game with "nigger".
 
?>>263125: ProcGen infinite dungeon area based on the ruins of an ancient mysterious extinct mystic civilization.
 
?>>262203: Remix of Libera Me From Hell as /v/-tan bossfight theme. >>265717: this remix [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCmSb40sV1Y]
 
?>>262144: Wes should be weirded out once they get their first random encounter and comment on it. Jay should for once call him the casual instead.
 
?>>256771: add some situation where you can't pass through an area where /sp/ and /tv/ are having a turf war might be fun, especially if you need to seek out the legendary /fitlit/ to intervene.
 
?>>256380: the ability to romance a cute loli
 
?>>256575: the currency is chainlink
 
?>>259995: Chef character in the castle kitchen asks you to bring him various foods dropped by surrounding enemies around the castle to make your first basic health potion (soup). There's a checklist of more increasingly harder to get ingredients dropped by monsters as you go through the game, each time they are brought back to the chef he makes a better soup that you can only buy from him, and has better hp recovery and has chances to add occasional buffs. The best soup is the only item in the game that can heal the whole party to max health in a single use.
 
?>>259977:How about a mysterious npc that sells shit far way in to dungeons or trades rare itens for treasures found in the dungeons? Maybe a wizard like person or a rabbit
 
?>>259093: add an optionable buildable base, like Suikeden Densetsu or Breath of Fire II
 
?>>257791:
>Wes and Jay make a pitstop in /b/etroit
>>Giganigga's daughter Nigqueesha has gone missing; he thinks a crossboarder kidnapped her
>>after interrogating a couple of people in nearby cities you discover she ran off to become the new queen of /v/
>>Giganigga wanted Nigqueesha to abandon her love of fashion to pursue a career in GET threads
>>after fighting off a wave of /v/irgins Giganigga offers to join your party, with the goal of finding the ultimate GET so Nigqueesha can be free pursue her dreams
>>the GET never gets brought back up again I don't fucking know
 
?>>257498: recruitable shota >>257646 it's /qst/
 
?>>256771: I think some situation where you can't pass through an area where /sp/ and /tv/ are having a turf war might be fun, especially if you need to seek out the legendary /fitlit/ to intervene.
 
?>>252197:Two possible ways the the battle can end. you pray to moot and a mod deletes Todd or he pulls up the console after you beat him, kills your party members and begins to start his plan but forgets to run LOOT and skyrim.exe has stops working.
 
?>>252194: the shopkeeper is both breedable and can be romanced.also every girls ingame can become thick due of food or breeding. unlocks grand architect ending
 
?>>251893: Hiroshimoot is the actual real final boss
 
?>>251860: shop keeper is the mastermind of the Todd howard evil and is the super secret final final boss.
 
?>>251746: Wes and Jay are aware of savescumming, Like have events that are chance-based and for the game to know if the player has quickloaded
 
?>>250978:I think it makes more sense to play as Wes purely cause WRPG is know for having a ton of dialogue choices. Though, you could give the player the choice of playing as both characters. Jay as a silent protagonist, Wes for dialogue choices
 
?>>250316: Shota Wes as an alt. costume and Jes(a fusion of both Wes and Jay) as a secret unlockable character.
 
?>>248560: There should be a hidden booth in a city for borno of Jay and Wes and people go in and request the weirdest shit and in the end its just stickman doodles.
 
?>>247480: have the main opening theme be something similar to "4chan 4ever" [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NNMHxqJp6A]
 
?>>239122: call an anime version of Wes "Sexw"
 
? >>233441: splitting the "story" into small chunks that can be mixed and matched as you play the game.
 
?>>234148: characters level up at different rates. Wes and Jay level up slowly but get much more powerful than everyone else and the tans all level up really quick, but are for certain types of play, or have special immunities. the board tans could give accessories to the player whenyou hit level 100 with any tan, and both Wes and Jay get a permanent bonus to their stats or learn a new spell.
 
?>>232450:The rats should have standard attacks like Lacerat and Eviscerat and also special moves like Ratastrophe and Ratosphere. And maybe some buffs like Rat of War.
 
?>>232332: giant sewer rat as a party member
 
?>>252220: 
-Moonman boss battle
-"You like to play castlevania" moment 
-Nigga stealing your bike
-A rollercoaster ride battle marathon that can't be ended unless you do something special.
 
?>>251791: Jay should have proper/long animations for her attacks, her last spells should be basically a cutscene and she should have a dumb super bar like FF`s limit break. Wes' attacks should be dull/boring but he should be able to have the greatest amount of options on stuff to do out of battle, like crafting, dialogue choices and all that stuff.
 
?>>251454: obstacles in the games are all either terrain, magic walls or locked doors. Jay and Wes constantly use wrong/glitched methods to get over them, such as clipping through doors etc.
 
?>>251767 "using" bucket on the shopkeeper makes her entire stock free for this shop but using it often brings down Wes' karma and fucks him over with a massive debuff. As a reward for not doing it once during the entire playthrough, shopkeep becomes a party member
 
?>>251592: A rival should be added
 
?>>251519: all Wes' equipment should be themed as "mods".
 
?>>250943: Wes ad Jay is chosen because they are related to an ancient hero, /v/. Everyone thinks he is dead, but /v/ has become a fallen hero, instead of a hero of light, he is a hero of darkness. >>251003: /v/ is undead. >>251046: Has the little Reddit antenna on his head.
 
?>>251140: first obstacle to get to new areas of the map is just a mountain. you have to obtain a horse so Jay and Wes can use the horse to hike the mountain
 
?>>250554: status effects that matter and work during boss fights
 
?>>250159: real time combat
 
?>>248471: Every enemy is taken from a JRPG because their enemies have literally nothing to do with the world or story most of the time and have silly and random names.
 
?>>247922: "Meme Lord" as a class
 
?>>247756: Instead learning spells leveling up, you learns skills by killing monsters x times like: You kills 10 slime and you learn 'slime slash' or You kills 10 healslime and you learn 'cure'.
 
?>>247158: artists should lean heavily towards a kind of pixelly-mspaint-oekaki style that you see in a lot of rage comics, reaction images, etc etc. >>247374: the backround for board-tan portraits could be Yotsuba or Yotsuba B colors depending on the board being sfw or nsfw.
 
?>>247289: Jay has two hat slots: Hat and then hat inside of hat. When Jay's hat is removed, Hat Slime becomes a playable party member. Similar white mage playstyle but with more offensive capabilities. Resists physical attacks and has a passive heal over time but Weak to fire damage
 
?>>242515 "Komm Susser Todd Howard" as the title of the game
 
?>>238812: "Wave Warrior" as the title of the game
 
?>>235786: The dialog should be G rated to keep a more professional feel, barring few occasion for impact, but the protag should be foul mouthed, but without using any direct foul language
 
?>>233144: have the game start similarly as DQ1: The Princess (Jay) has been kidnapped by Todd Howard, and one of his Skyrim dragons is keeping her under lock and key. a deviation: The King is (as far as I understand the lore?) /vr/, and he's already sent Wes out to try and find her but figures that Wes is off doing sidequests instead of the main plot. Eventually when we get there, Wes is in the middle of a sidequest when Anon comes across him and is convinced to finish the hunt for his sister, and when they get to the dragon, Jay's either already gotten it beaten or is making it do JRPG things instead of WRPG things and making it confused/weird for her to join you two and beat it up. IF the player goes back to not! Tantegel, /vr/ will also join up at this point too. If not, he's missable as a party member.
 
?>>232367: do a walking bear party member
 
?>>232346: Giant sewer rats that walk around like normal people and ambush you at some point in the story or someshit. Like how you see those webms of bears walking around like normal people
 
?>>232332: Add giant sewer rats in some section as a parody and have one of them join your party. >>232344: King of the rats... He joins you to fulfill the rat census by meeting every rat. 
 
?>>232190: one region would devoid of life for except machines. for the general designs, mostly inspired by FF13 design tech or something like that. for example: the manasvin warmech could be the 'design reference' of most enemies in said region or even bosses.
?>>231839: A timid little girl party member who pisses herself whenever something scary happens. >>232353: she farts sometimes too
 
? >>197719: Todd is filling reality with memetic hazards (memes) which the more influence they have, the more powerful they become, slowly robbing NPC/Random people of their ability to converse and only be able to spread the memetic hazard (meme) further. Todd`s plan is to first use a bunch of memetic hazards on each town, which will be spread by his meme-representatives (which will be each town`s boss), the MC will have to defeat these meme-representatives, but only defeating them is not enough, the MC also has to find the artifacts said in act 2 so he can counter or erase the memetic hazard that is spreading in said town. Todd`s plan is to spread memetic hazards over the entire world, and then cast an ancient spell known only to him, which will turn all of these memetic hazards into Skyrim memetic hazards, making it the most powerful hazard to the point it acquires the power to slowly turn reality into Skyrim.
 
?  >>184081:The Protag will be tutored by a wizard who then tragically dies fighting off the ancient evil
 
? >>183414: The magic is based on memes. Could be that you collect memes from talking to NPCs or exploring, instead of gaining them through leveling up. Like finding a frog on a uni cycle gives you a spell based on the "here comes that boy" meme. Could split them as: "dank" memes, which are black magic."Fresh" memes, which are white magic."wholesome" memes, which are support magic. "cursed" memes which are status effect spells.
 
? >>196034: split the regions based on how the boards are split on the home page.
 
? >>196435: Add Fuhrer (The one with sunglasses) from Persona 2: Innocent Sin.
 
? >>199528: The opening quest is a job to defeat poltards terrorizing a small village
 
? >>201625: the final boss is a /pol/ack bipedal nuclear tank
 
? >>208837: Fight The MSPAINT head on the cover of the album "The cult of Ray" by Black Francis
 
? >>213157: Add a metal slime equivalent that's impossible to kill
 
? >>198958: Todd has infected people with Radiant quests that turn them into NPC questgivers. It's like a pathogen that spreads to everyone they "give quests to". Like if a mom has the virus and she tells her child to "go buy some groceries", the child is now on a Radiant quest and becomes infected. His plan of world domination comes to fruition when everyone is an NPC.
 
? >>230453: we should prioritize the design of some good rat enemies  
 
?>>199335 and >>199493: a God, maybe Gaben or Tom Sawyer
 
? >>199661: unique dialogue depending on the name you input at the beginning
 
? >>204109: a skeleton on the main playable cast.
 
? >>211887 
>An ancient being known as Todd Howard has awoken from his slumber, he is an ancient being who was once slain and sealed by the ancient hero Gabe Newell, due in part to the effort of Todd's followers who've spent the last few centuries freeing him.
>Todd Howard is a memetic entry who wants to rewrite reality into a paradise that he calls "Skyrim", currently, reality is a low fantasy world with little to no magic, and no supernatural beasts. But once Todd Howard successfully rewrites reality, magic will become commonplace, magical beasts will roam the earth, and the benevolent gods will be replaced with cruel and callous beings known as the "daedra" and the "aedra".
>this is a bad thing because of how society would implode do everyone, even the lowliest bandit or rapist having magic in addition to a pantheon of gods willing to fuck you over at the drop of a hat
>>everyone in the current reality would also have their personalities rewritten to match and accept this reality, which begs the question, what does it mean to be human? Are you truly the same if your very core has been changed?
>Thats why Todd must be stopped before his plan can come to fruition, a prophecy has been put into place: a 30 year old wizard whom is pure of heart and also a virigin can resist the taint of the memetic influence incurred by Todd by combing his pure heart, his virginity, and his magic. This man will be destined to travel the land, destroy Todd's influence, and stop Todd before he can rewrite reality.
>The game would start when Todd had only rewritten like 40% of reality, so the earlier areas would be full of bandits and low fantasy enemies, while the higher level areas would be full of fantastical beasts and Todds most trusted comrades such as Pete Hines
>Final battle would be Todd Howard powered up by modifications from his followers called "mods"
>The player character would be able to "free" people by using his powers, this could be a way to unlock companions later in the game, while also showcasing his power lore wise
 
? >>214813 & >>234337: No niggers, or brown, tanned skin as they are too close to niggers. 
 
? >>197317: Maybe the reason they're the final boss is because they're fighting each other to be THE vrpg-tan and deal collateral damage to other boards. Your choices will impact who will be the last one to survive after they fuse into an eldritch horror space overlord.
? >>230517: "depression" should be a status effect in combat
 
? >>230699: make an engaging story that can be role-played and stop filling it with trash 99% of us don't care about.
 
? >>227592: one of the later bosses is /v/-tan.
 
? >>227636: Wes turns on the group
 
? >>227752: Beetleson sacrifices himself to save the rest of the party.
 
? >>197245: Something about the environment in the story
 
? >>212433 & 246632: Rats, not as simply an enemy, but as a setting and theme
 
? >>213335: Shop keeper as every shopkeeper in the game is a must.
 
? >>220354: Emmy Moe is a good mom. / Wes has every port of skyrim as Todd Howard's spirit haunts him when given the choice to buy one.
 
? >>222704: without Jay's hat, she has a negative intelligence score, but is still able to function
 
? >>228432: Jay Trusts no slime except the one on her hat
 
? >>228818: Slime society is based around dysgenics
 
? >>230857

?  >>212167: Some ideas about the ghost shit just being something RPG respawning and them being stuck inside like an anime convention or specific videogame setting or something. I feel like there's a lot of opportunities for good jokes (hair thing being Htan's untamed muff growth?) and it's a lot more unique (and more easy to do an obvious parody of) than the other games. But it literally won't win.
 
 
 
????????????????????????List of enemy ideas????????????????????????
 
 
>>212248: Spooky ghosts and Bioware rats
>>212251: obligatory bandits
>>212262: Poop(er) bandits
>>232318: a Nuclear bipedal platform
>>212332: slime
>>212345: ectoplasm
>>233401: monster girls
>>233761: an anteater but with the traits of a dragon
>>233885: a red snake, but at the end of its tail is a frog with its mouth open, implying that the snake is actually just the tongue of the frog
>>235210: Giant Enemy Crab
>>241849: level 1 slime girls.
>>245021: Pedobear enemy that does extra damage to Jay
>>246635: the furries and sonichus from /v/es rage [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEGonpggpvo]. also gondolas
>>247264: A slime that controls a set of armour, it's killed an adventurer/knight/whatever and instead of absorbing the armour it's decided to emulate it's pray in a form of mimicry. Doesn't immediately aggro but instead actually beckons to the player. When the player gets within range it the slime body will strike by opening the helmet visor and quickly lashing out like a lance, same happens with the gloves as well. When defeated the armour will drop to the ground and break, but there is a chance a piece will be lootable.
>>247594: Lion with a star as a body and a big noise
>>247963: EL CHUPACABRA
>>251631: niggers
>>252371: Livyathan, A 'wall' type enemy, think FFIV / VII / XII. A huge growth of ivy that grows and expands rapidly. Pioneer tendrils creep out to ensnare characters, binding and constricting them. Blossoms summon swarms of hostile insects, pollen falls give status effects and every so often the shoots will arrange themselves in the semblance of a serpent which will appear rise and dive across the surface.
>>259869: Tentacle monster boss with scarred giant human head. His boss music is Tank from cowboy bebop and when defeated he says "see you space cowboy" and vanishes. Should appear at the most random time coming from space.
>>256584: Grace Bruxner's hair bun
>>197245: Coronazombies. Use precious canned food and toilet papers to keep the zombies at bay, spray ink on kkk ghosts to exorcise them, and root out anti-vaxxer cultists who feed the wounded paint thinner and gasoline to "cure" them.

--------------TAN LORE IDEAS
? >>220254 (Not the originator): Jay has a pet beetle named Beetleson that is also her summon mount
 
? >>220043
>Jay is just as much of a gacha addict, but she's f2p and still rolls more 5 stars than /vmg/
>wes thinks she's a fucking casual with no taste
>moe cant play mobile games since she's a skeleton
>hoe enjoys shapeshifting into /vmg/'s waifus and teasing her about how she'll never roll all of them
>/vmg/ thinks beetleson is a limited-time SSR unit, and tries to kidnap him all the time
 
 
 
?>>>228812: Jay's Hat slime is an exile because it's INT was too high
 
 
 
 
 
 
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX -Ideas that contradict cemented ideas- XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
 
?>>235911: having maximum of 4 character that are mechanically deep, of standard rpg level, while the remaining roster are lighter character that can be uswd to ease the game or tailors the party to a certain play-style, and have much lower level cap. There are two ways that I prefer this: 3 major permanent party member and 3 more slot for lighter support interchangeable characters Or 1 major main character and remaining 3 to 5 slot for support party member.
 
?>>250626: don't include ANY board culture in this game.
 
?>>250176
>Party of four members.
>Jay
>Wes
>Moe
>Hoe
>Beetleson
>Hat Slime
>and maybe Shopkeeper 
>Are your options for party members.
 
? >>236027: Wes and Jay are primary protags from the very beginning and they meet Hoe and Emma and form a party. these two go through seperate character arcs (with Hoe learning who her mom is and Emma making peace with /vg/ and being laid to rest in his backyard, at the end of which they abandon the party). Wes and Jay, who've undergone an arc of their own, are left to face the final boss
 
 
?>>248012: MC should have his name be a play on the words "Roleplaying" to form two names, like Rore Pray
 
? >>192619: the virgin earns his wizard powers
 
? >>204967: The character name should be limited to a number of three slots as a reference to all of our board-tans having three letter names.
? >>197245: v, tg, and qst off on a quest to defeat vrpg-tan. Travel through a, k, toy, and finally i, where vrpg-tan draws their final boss forms into existence. v is raw dps and stat buffer. Has trouble dealing single target damage unless all the minions are dead.
tg is ailment slinger and healer. Can pick off individual units with attacks that always deal at least 2 ailments.
qst is tank and summoner. Regains MP by blocking, and recruits allies from each of the boards.
 
? >>229939: Ideas revolving around Starting party. 
>If as a party
qst, v, tg
vg, vrpg, vr
vrpg, vmg, qa
 
>Starting alone
vrpg
vmg
A literal blank slate, with the chosen class drawn on with ink marker
An anthropomorphic pc/console
vr
someone like The Batter, a dues vult character who's literally just there to kill demons
A talking kinder egg
